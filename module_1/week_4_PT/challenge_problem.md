# SQL-Challenge-Problem

## The Situation:

Dallas Police Department compiled information on Officer-involved shootings in the greater Dallas, TX area with the intent of providing transparency to citizens. An overview of this effort can be found on the [Dallas PD Website](http://www.dallaspolice.net/ois/ois).

## The Database:

This database contains three tables: Incidents, Officers, and Subjects. Explore the data in each of the tables in dallas-ois.sqlite.
  
## Your Challenge: 

Join the tables together by incident number. Then, do the following: 

* Select all rows in which the victim was killed or injured. Make tables with the counts associated with victim weapon type, officer names, and grand jury disposition. Then, answer these questions:
* How many of them were unarmed? 
* Were any officers involved in multiple cases? 
* How many cases are still pending? 
* How many of the cases had an officer and victim of the same race? 

Create a Jupyter notebook as a class and work on this collaboratively, using Slack and pull requests. Matt and I will collect the class's notebook from this folder on Friday night.

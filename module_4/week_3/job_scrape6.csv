Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!       But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)       Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

You sleep, eat, and breath Excel and R, but are tired of working task lists in a slow-moving corporation. You enjoy the process of discovering new data challenges, and want the freedom to create meaningful solutions in real-time. You are constantly learning, teaching yourself new disciplines, and you are obsessed with the potential uses of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. You want the autonomy and responsibility that comes with being the company’s go-to resource for all-things data.       In this role, you will translate complex business challenges into data tasks – our managers and clients know what’s wrong, and it is up to you to investigate in the data, determine the cause, and devise an elegant solution. You will continually refine your models to learn from increasing amounts of available information. You will decide what data points should be silently corrected, vs. highlighted with intuitive suggestions. This suggestion engine will be the foundation of the company’s core product.

What you get:     Outstanding benefits, including fully-paid health insurance, 401k, commuter benefits, generous vacation, BYOD compensation, etc.   Flexible work environment – e.g. working from home, shifted hours, etc.   Potentially, equity shares in the company, depending on your experience   The unique experience, pride and status that comes from being one of the first employees of a software startup   The opportunity to build your own team as we expand, and shape the entire company/product   The opportunity to “do it right” this time.

Butovsky lab has made seminal discoveries including the identification of the TGFβ-dependent homeostatic M0-microglia and the second major neurodegenerative MGnD-microglia phenotype, which is regulated by TREM2-APOE pathway. These findings led to the establishment of national and international collaborations to develop microglial targets to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The group specializes in the generation of novel methods including: 1) microglia arrays utilizing novel spatial technologies to determine unique microglia phenotypes associated with pathologies; 2) generation of microglia and monocyte specific mAbs; 3) generation of transgenic mice to target microglia and myeloid brain infiltrates; 4) developing PET-based microglial biomarkers; and 5) developing microglia-specific therapeutic delivery strategies.       The Lab investigates: 1) environmental cues, early life stress, and genetic factors which affect microglial functions for development of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases; 2) developing a novel transgenic mouse model to specifically target/modulate neurodegenerative-microglia subset; 3) replacing microglia carrying major AD gene risk factors with functional microglia utilizing iPSCs; 4) reprogramming human blood monocytes into microglia-like cells to restore microglial functions; 5) modulating and restoring functional crosstalk between microglia-monocyte and microglia-adaptive immunity in neuroinflammation; 6) identification of immune cell-based biomarkers predictive of ALS progression.       Our goal is to decipher the complex molecular interactions in microglia in neurodegenerative diseases in order to identify key regulators to modulate gene expression and functions in microglia which could provide a path to treating neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Multiple sclerosis.

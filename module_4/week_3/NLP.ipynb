    "It is a field in machine learning/deep learning that deals with understanding, analyzing, manipulating and generating language. Humans communicate through language on multiple mediums these days. It gets complicated. There is context, intonation, inflection and body language. The first major advancement in machine language processing was in 1950 when Alan Turing published \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\". This paper establsihed the Turing Test, a criterion for how well a computer could impersonate a human. In 1957, Noam Chomsky's paper on Syntactic Structures revolutionized our understanding of linguistics. But a few decades passed without any real progress. It wasn't until the late 80's when ML algorithms were introduced that NLP showed real promise.\n",

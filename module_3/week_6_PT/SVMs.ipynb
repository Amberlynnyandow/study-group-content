    "In case of linearly separable data in two dimensions, as shown in Fig. 1, a typical machine learning algorithm tries to find a boundary that divides the data in such a way that the misclassification error can be minimized. If you closely look at Fig. 1, there can be several boundaries that correctly divide the data points. The two dashed lines as well as one solid line classify the data correctly.\n",

    "1. Soft Margin: try to find a line to separate, but tolerate one or few misclassified dots (e.g. the dots circled in red)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Kernel Trick: try to find a non-linear decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soft Margin \n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of misclassifications are tolerated by SVM under **soft margin:**\n",
    "1. The dot is on the wrong side of the decision boundary but on the correct side/ on the margin (shown in left)\n",

In Sklearn, it is represented as the penalty term — ‘C’. The bigger the C, the more penalty SVM gets when it makes misclassification. Therefore, the narrower the margin is and fewer support vectors the decision boundary will depend on.\n",

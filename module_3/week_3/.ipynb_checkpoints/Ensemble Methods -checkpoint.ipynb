    "### Simple Ensemble Techniques - How do we use the wisdom of the crowd? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Max Voting** - The max voting method is generally used for classification problems. In this technique, multiple models are used to make predictions for each data point. The predictions by each model are considered as a ‘vote’. The predictions which we get from the majority of the models are used as the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you asked 5 of your colleagues to rate your movie (out of 5); we’ll assume three of them rated it as 4 while two of them gave it a 5. Since the majority gave a rating of 4, the final rating will be taken as 4. You can consider this as taking the mode of all the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Averaging** - Similar to the max voting technique, multiple predictions are made for each data point in averaging. In this method, we take an average of predictions from all the models and use it to make the final prediction. Averaging can be used for making predictions in regression problems or while calculating probabilities for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted Averaging** - This is an extension of the averaging method. All models are assigned different weights defining the importance of each model for prediction. For instance, if two of your colleagues are critics, while others have no prior experience in this field, then the answers by these two friends are given more importance as compared to the other people.\n",

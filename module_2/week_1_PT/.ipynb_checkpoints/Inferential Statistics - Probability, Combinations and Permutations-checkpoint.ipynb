    "Earlier we looked at descriptive statistics: starting with a dataset and making various observations (overall shape, histogram, outliers, etc.) as well as calculations of quantities that can characterize the dataset as a whole (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the move into inferential statistics, we need to imagine now that we don't have (or anyway cannot measure) all the data of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is, of course, the typical situation. Consider:\n",

    "- A zoologist wanting to know the typical lifespan of a Siberian tiger\n",
    "- A cosmologist wanting to know the mass of a normal white dwarf star\n",
    "- A businesswoman wanting to know how many M&M's her customers should expect to find in their Party Size bags\n",
    "- A botanist wanting to know how tall California redwoods usually grow\n",
    "\n",
    "The zoologist could, in principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep track of every currently existing Siberian tiger; record their (more or less) exact ages at their moments of death; add up those ages and divide by the number of tigers to calculate an average lifespan ‚Äì‚ÄìBut only in principle. In all of these situations, there is no realistic or practical opportunity to check each relevant data point.\n",

    "\n",
    "Does this help? The hope, of course, is that our sample will be representative of the population as a whole, which would justify our using facts about the sample to infer things about the population as a whole.

    "What is set theory?<br/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "A set is a collection of some items (elements). We often use capital letters to denote a set. To define a set we can simply list all the elements in curly brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:** \n",
    "- to define a set **A** that consists of the two elements ‚ô£ and ‚ô¢, we write **A**={‚ô£,‚ô¢}. To say that ‚ô¢ belongs to **A**, we write **‚ô¢‚ààA**, where \"‚àà\" is pronounced \"belongs to.\" To say that an element does not belong to a set, we use ‚àâ. To express this, we may write **‚ô°‚àâA**.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The symbols \"|\" and \":\" are pronounced \"such that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A={x|x satisfies some property} <br/>\n",

    "A={x:x satisfies some property}\n",

    "\n",
    "**Inclusion-exclusion principle:**\n",
    "Note that if you want to know how many elements are in set *A* versus set  *B*, you can't simply sum up the elements, because they have elements in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "In combinational mathematics, the inclusion-exclusion principle is a counting technique that solves this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "When having two sets, the method for counting the number of elements in the union of two finite sets is given by:\n",

    "|A‚à™B|=|A|+|B|‚àí|A‚à©B|,\n",
